Exercise 5

Using the guide at https://socket.io/get-started/chat as a helper, try to implement a basic chat app which includes one of their suggested extensions (or come up with your own!):

● Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
● Add support for nicknames.
● Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message
directly as soon as he/she presses enter.
● Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
● Show who’s online.

steps:
npm init
npm install express
npm install socket.io
basic boiler plate inside index.js define port and input sock.io code
create index.html
expand code further to include features.
 - time stamp for vid is July 8 58 minutes in.

 - expanded on to finalize exercise. Built in the nickname feature input message bar at bottom but will need to further explore declaring nickname changes and active user lists.
