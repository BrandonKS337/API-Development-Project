Try creating an express application for a blog website using Sequelize. You can refer to Module 8 for the logical/physical models

Requirements
- Your system should have a proper MVC structure
- The system should be able to create users
- The users should be able to create multiple posts (posts should be very basic, title/desc/img)
- other users should be able to like the posts and comment on them

copy and pasted this code into previous exercise to just update both files for sequelize requirement.
